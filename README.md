bf3mf-legacy
bf3mf-legacy is a legacy Battlefield 3 matchmaking platform designed specifically for clans. This project, created in 2012, represents the early stages of my journey into PHP and programming. While the code quality may not meet modern standards, it successfully served its intended purpose during its time.

Features
Detailed Matchmaking: Enjoy in-depth matchmaking with a range of customizable filters to find the perfect opponents.

Match/Clan-war Arrangement: Organize matches and clan wars effortlessly, fostering competitive gameplay within your community.

Team Profiles: Empower your teams with custom avatars, descriptions, and more, allowing them to express their unique identity.

Private Messaging: Facilitate communication between team administrators through a secure private messaging system.

Notifications: Stay informed with a notifications system that keeps you updated on important events and activities within the platform.

Note
This project was developed using a custom MVC-like system, even before I was aware of the MVC design pattern. While the code may not be up to modern standards, it remains a testament to the early days of my programming journey and the functionality it brought to the Battlefield 3 clan community.

Please be aware that this project is considered legacy, and its codebase may not be suitable for production use without substantial refactoring and modernization. Nevertheless, it serves as a historical artifact of its time and can provide insights into the evolution of web development practices.
